## Inputs and Why They Are Missing

You may notice that sample inputs and puzzle inputs from Advent of Code are not included in this repository. This is intentional for the following reasons:

1. **Copyright Concerns:** The inputs provided by Advent of Code are copyrighted, and redistributing them directly violates their terms of service.

2. **Personalized Inputs:** The puzzle inputs are unique to each participant, meaning my input files may not be relevant or useful for your solutions.

If you’d like to run these solutions, you can copy your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) website and place them in the appropriate directory.

**Input directory structure**

```
./resources
    │
    ├───day01
    │       example.txt
    │       input.txt
    │
    ├───day02
    │       example.txt
    │       input.txt
    │
   ...
```
